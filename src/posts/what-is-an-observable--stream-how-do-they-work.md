Streams are a handy tool to structure your application with asynchronous execution in mind. The core idea is to model the dataflow as a stream where at runtime data can be emitted at any time. In this talk we will first go over the basic usage of streams, then build our own small RxJS with that to see what the differences between hot and cold streams are.
