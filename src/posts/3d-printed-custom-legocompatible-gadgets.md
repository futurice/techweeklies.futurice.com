Futurice is known for lean digital service creation. How do we extend past just talking about IoT and taking AI out into the world? One approach is rapid prototyping of physical services using LEGO. Paul and Willie will talk about using this to make an autonomous 1:10 drift car and other gadgets with http://pelablocks.org . This is Futurice's own open source solution, created to allow fast, in-the-field prototypes and modifications using any electronics and software of your choice.

Presenter: Paul Houghton and Wilfried Bock
