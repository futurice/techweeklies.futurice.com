<!--- You can insert a short description here -->
Still remember mid March 2020? Most people were still working at the office, and the national pastime was hoarding toilet paper and hand sanitizer? Me neither, seems a lifetime ago.

In the beginning of the lockdown, nobody had any idea how quickly the novel coronavirus was spreading in Finland. Many - including the Health Security Director of THL - were calling for an app to crowdsource symptom data from the general population, in the hopes that it could be used to track the spread of the epidemic. Futurice, in close collaboration with Helsingin Sanomat and medical experts, was one of those who answered the call. In this talk Jarno will go through the technical implementation of the resulting oiretutka.fi service.
