<!--- You can insert a short description here -->
Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of Open Source. The idea behind it is simple - create a minimum of 4 pull requests to open source repositories that are participating in the event. If you accomplish that goal, you get to choose a tee or plant trees.

This year was my second time participating, and I ended up being an (accidental) maintainer of an open-source repository. In this talk, I will introduce you to Hacktoberfest, and tell the story of Hacktoberfest 2020 from my perspective and share some learnings from this experience.

Presenter: Eeva-Jonna Panula, Developer
