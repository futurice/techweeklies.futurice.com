00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.583
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.010
<v ->Hello everybody, my name is Olavi</v>

3
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.823
and I'm going to demo an app called Sizzy,

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.500
I don't know how to pronounce it either.

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.300
How many of you have heard about it?

6
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.113
Okay cool, how many has tried it?

7
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.380
Nobody, okay that's good because this

8
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.603
is a good thing to demo it then.

9
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.090
So, sizzy.app is created by this guy called Kitze

10
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.450
on Twitter, and I'm following him so that's why

11
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.620
I have been hearing about this app

12
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.525
for a couple months now.

13
00:00:41.525 --> 00:00:43.900
Quite a lot, because he's posting

14
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.830
all the time about it and I think he's right now

15
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.853
working full time on this app and it's pretty cool.

16
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.490
This project used to be an open source, free

17
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.109
project, web-based program that you could use.

18
00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.660
But as the title of this Medium post says

19
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.360
"GitHub stars won't pay your rent",

20
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.240
so they decided to make it then a commercial product.

21
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.240
So, let's first look into their website and what

22
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.938
they claim the app is doing and then I'll show

23
00:01:18.938 --> 00:01:22.240
how it works in reality and I will be talking

24
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.207
a bit about my experiences.

25
00:01:24.207 --> 00:01:29.109
So, Sizzy is a browser for developers and designers

26
00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:31.660
as you can see on the website.

27
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.920
By the way, they have super nice videos,

28
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.700
their release notes are actually videos and those

29
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.100
are super funny as well, and on the website they

30
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.560
have nice videos explaining all the cool features,

31
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.010
but I don't show the videos now because

32
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.380
it's kind of a waste of time.

33
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.480
I'll just quickly glance over the website

34
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.160
so you can see some of the features.

35
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.270
So, the basic view is that you have the same website

36
00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.270
in multiple devices and screen sizes at the same time.

37
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.352
And they claim that everything is in perfect sync,

38
00:02:09.352 --> 00:02:12.150
let's see if this video loads here.

39
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.970
So you can see when you scroll, they're in perfect sync.

40
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.760
At least they claim so.

41
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.560
And you can scroll to any element on the page,

42
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.674
you can navigate,

43
00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:26.674
you can edit, you have help reloading

44
00:02:26.983 --> 00:02:30.800
of course, if your project has problems with reloading.

45
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.833
And you have dev tools, which is good.

46
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.290
Yeah, let's see.

47
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.590
This webpage is actually not that good, because

48
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.033
it loads the content lazily, and if your network

49
00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:45.470
is a little bit slow, then you do see blank pages.

50
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.973
And then you can take screenshots,

51
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.130
and here is the pricing.

52
00:02:51.752 --> 00:02:56.383
So, solo is $5 a month, Trio is licensing

53
00:03:00.372 --> 00:03:02.093
for three devices, so if you have three devices,

54
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.113
you have to buy this license I guess.

55
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.253
But yeah, I guess most of us develop on one device mostly.

56
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.690
I think we can dive straight into my demo application

57
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.523
that I created.

58
00:03:19.523 --> 00:03:24.370
So I just made to showing how this works,

59
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.350
it's best to display with a web project.

60
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.380
So, here we go.

61
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.904
We have CC.app running.

62
00:03:32.904 --> 00:03:37.904
By default, it shows you which part you navigate to,

63
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.790
you add the address here,

64
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.390
so it's basically a browser but it shows it

65
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.120
in multiple web views, or multiple screen sizes,

66
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.513
and shows a screen, what do they call it, like,

67
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.500
a screen around a web page,

68
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.330
so you can customize that, so if you don't like

69
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.120
to see the fake device there, you can hide it,

70
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.806
or minimize it, make it smaller.

71
00:04:03.806 --> 00:04:07.240
By default, you have the iPhones first and then

72
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.323
the larger screens, some Androids and iPads,

73
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.463
Macbook, laptop, desktop, whatever.

74
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.410
And you can of course customize these,

75
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.020
so you can go to settings and devices,

76
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.373
and then, no not here, I was wrong,

77
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.710
add device, at least, and organize devices.

78
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.100
So here you can edit them, add more,

79
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.190
and this is nice actually that you have some presets

80
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.360
here so you can just select these and hide if you

81
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.550
don't like to see so many iPhones at the beginning,

82
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.450
you can hide them.

83
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.320
One of the things they claim on the website

84
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.748
was that everything is in perfect sync

85
00:04:51.748 --> 00:04:56.748
which is not the case, at least to my experience.

86
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.350
So when you scroll, it should scroll everything

87
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.590
at the same time, so there was the effect,

88
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.080
it doesn't always, yeah, now it came.

89
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.130
As you see, it's not perfect but at least when

90
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.980
it scrolls everything, it's kind of nice that you can see

91
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.170
that scrolling on all devices.

92
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.660
And I'll try to demo a small thing where this

93
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.150
could be probably useful for somebody.

94
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.930
So here's my nice application, it looks okay because

95
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.580
this is how I designed it, but then when I scroll down

96
00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.260
and look at it on, so I want to scroll a bit down,

97
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.123
and look at it on, for example, this iPad.

98
00:05:38.123 --> 00:05:40.700
I think the text is way too small,

99
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.741
but I wouldn't have noticed if I would have just

100
00:05:42.741 --> 00:05:45.700
focused on the iPhone's here.

101
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.140
So I'm just gonna go fix that, real quickly,

102
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:53.140
with the hack it the font size two rems, change here

103
00:05:53.906 --> 00:05:57.180
let's see, content loading, okay so it made

104
00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.170
it actually bigger on the iPhones as well,

105
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.283
but it's fine, and now it looks a bit better.

106
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.750
But, yeah, you can fix it better as well,

107
00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.750
this is just a stupid example of how you can fix stuff.

108
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.740
And, okay, so I will look at my slides now,

109
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.690
which are this webpage,

110
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.690
so the good thing about this app is that it makes

111
00:06:23.097 --> 00:06:27.411
it simple and quick to test on multiple devices

112
00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:28.606
as you can see.

113
00:06:28.606 --> 00:06:32.130
And the app actually does one thing,

114
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.380
and it does it quite well,

115
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.000
and it's only focusing on this one thing,

116
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.720
and that's a good thing.

117
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.710
And these are Chrome web wheels, or, yeah,

118
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.120
Chrome web wheels here, so you can use Chrome

119
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.320
web tools to inspect these and that's really cool

120
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.770
because, I don't know, I at least use Chrome,

121
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.373
so I'm most used to using Chrome web tools, and that's cool.

122
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.520
And it works on Linux, as you can see

123
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.213
I'm running Linux, and it has an app image

124
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.133
that I can use on Linux.

125
00:07:10.852 --> 00:07:13.745
And it's customizable, you can, for example,

126
00:07:13.745 --> 00:07:16.610
as I showed you, you can customize the devices,

127
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.020
and then you can customize the themes,

128
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.013
so you can change the background color if you like,

129
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:26.170
and then you can, here you can, choose not to show

130
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.410
the device frame, and not show

131
00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:31.640
the operating system and browser.

132
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.413
You can show a minimalistic device frame if you'd like to.

133
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.733
Yep, so now I've changed the background color

134
00:07:39.733 --> 00:07:44.190
and yeah, then let's go to some of the cons

135
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.290
in my opinion. Please bare in mind, these are

136
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:51.480
my opinions and I have been using this

137
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.350
for three days now, or something.

138
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:57.560
I asked this in Slack, if some of us have been using

139
00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.430
this and then nobody answered, and Mattias suggested

140
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.870
to me to try it out and tell you about it.

141
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:06.330
So, one of the first things is that

142
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.950
it's an electron app, and I think many of us

143
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:12.393
know that it's a waste of memory.

144
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:17.090
Actually, yesterday I was developing this demo site

145
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:20.920
and I had my laptop on my lap and it got too hot

146
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.640
I couldn't continue doing it, so I think it uses

147
00:08:25.543 --> 00:08:27.560
quite a lot of memory, which is not good.

148
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:32.210
And I showed you, synchronized scrolling does

149
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.003
not work perfectly.

150
00:08:34.003 --> 00:08:36.873
And then one thing that was missing is tabs,

151
00:08:36.873 --> 00:08:41.470
so for example here I added a link to the Sizzy

152
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:45.770
app page, which opens in a new tab, but when I click

153
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.450
it, it doesn't open in a new tab because this app

154
00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:51.110
doesn't have tabs. So now I am here,

155
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.220
and I have to go back and I can't

156
00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.013
just close the tab.

157
00:08:56.892 --> 00:09:00.177
So, that's just one minor detail.

158
00:09:01.923 --> 00:09:06.923
And then these devices, are of course, just emulated

159
00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.910
devices, so they try to use the correct user agent

160
00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:17.340
and correct screen sizes and stuff like that

161
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.810
but, of course, you still have to test it on real

162
00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.810
devices, you can't trust on this if you really want

163
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.710
to make sure your app works perfectly.

164
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:32.200
And there are some quirks here, for example,

165
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:38.030
if I click this, I would expect all these screens to scroll

166
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:40.220
to the Cons section.

167
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.010
Let's see if I can demo it now,

168
00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:43.713
it doesn't happen every time.

169
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.720
Okay, anyways, there is a bug that all of the other

170
00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:53.340
screens refresh for some reason, and only the one

171
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.830
that I clicked scrolls down.

172
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:56.680
I don't know why.

173
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.573
I can't demo it now, but it happens quite often.

174
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.400
It's a bit difficult to see when the refresh is happening.

175
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.850
So for example, now it's refreshing, but sometimes

176
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.070
when you're developing locally and you have to compile

177
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:17.120
stuff and stuff like that happens, it might take a while

178
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.660
so you're not actually sure if it's reloading the page

179
00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.887
or not, because you can't see it that well.

180
00:10:21.887 --> 00:10:26.887
That's all from the negative stuff, but then there

181
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:29.803
are super minor things that I want to mention.

182
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.550
So we're developing an app with Next.js,

183
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:38.920
and I think the next.js dev mode has a bug that

184
00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.870
you can't have more than one tab open,

185
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.930
otherwise it gets slow.

186
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:45.120
So if you have this, if you're using

187
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.350
Sizzy, then it gets super slow, so I'm actually

188
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.840
not probably going to use this, or we're going

189
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.753
to have to figure out how to fix that bug in Next.js.

190
00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.943
This used to be an open source project, now it's commercial.

191
00:11:03.229 --> 00:11:05.560
And there's no free trial, but there's

192
00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.870
a money back guarantee for, what was it, 30 days.

193
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:11.833
I guess no questions asked.

194
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.930
You should just go try it out yourself if you like.

195
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:22.200
And one thing, just a super minor thing, on Linux

196
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.120
the app image doesn't add the app to the menu,

197
00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.650
so I have to start it from the console when I run it.

198
00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:33.200
So then you see some ugly garbage in the console when

199
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.873
you're running it, which I wouldn't like to see.

200
00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:43.610
I could maybe demo some of the features that I didn't

201
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:46.990
demo yet, which might actually be useful,

202
00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:49.730
so for example you can flip all the,

203
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:52.780
no, not here, that's the, okay,

204
00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:56.530
so you can change the scrolling of the devices,

205
00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:00.330
but now I can't scroll, yeah, so you have a horizontal

206
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.640
scroll, or then focus on only one device,

207
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.822
and then you can look at one device at a time.

208
00:12:05.822 --> 00:12:09.520
But then you can switch all the devices to landscape

209
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.560
if you like to, but yeah, it took a while

210
00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.609
to change the layout.

211
00:12:15.609 --> 00:12:17.720
It might be useful.

212
00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:22.720
Then you can zoom in all of the devices, and then reset too.

213
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.340
That might be useful, and this might be useful

214
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:31.053
as well if you want to quickly go to, for example,

215
00:12:31.053 --> 00:12:35.810
with the selector, for example, ID Cons, I can navigate,

216
00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:39.370
scroll down to the Cons section if I have an ID.

217
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:42.190
And this might be useful as well, if you have a lot

218
00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.130
of devices down here and then you can filter out devices.

219
00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.728
You can, for example, focus only on Android devices,

220
00:12:47.728 --> 00:12:52.728
only on iPads, only on desktop, or something.

221
00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:58.263
And then clear the filtering, I guess somehow, yeah.

222
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:06.210
That's basically it, do you have any questions or comments?

223
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.750
<v Host>Thanks for giving us the demo, and it looks like</v>

224
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.403
really interesting software.

225
00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.990
Where I see this maybe being useful

226
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:15.730
is I've gone to a lot of design reviews

227
00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:17.438
recently where we're going through the product

228
00:13:17.438 --> 00:13:19.057
and saying, "Okay, how is it looking

229
00:13:19.057 --> 00:13:20.370
"on all these different screens?"

230
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.580
And I think one of the disadvantages of Chrome

231
00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:24.670
is you can only look at one view at a time.

232
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.004
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->And also, at least</v>

233
00:13:26.004 --> 00:13:28.810
for me, when I'm switching contacts, right?

234
00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:30.530
Switching devices, it's sometimes not very

235
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:32.720
obvious, but it seems like it would be quite useful

236
00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.000
in that respect, or you're dealing

237
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.274
with the responsive nature.

238
00:13:35.274 --> 00:13:38.071
<v ->Yes, and we are actually using a storybook</v>

239
00:13:38.071 --> 00:13:41.710
and we are kind of missing this feature from storybook,

240
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:46.350
would be nice to have storybook display, multiple devices

241
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:47.420
at the same time.

242
00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:48.258
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->But then we can,</v>

243
00:13:48.258 --> 00:13:50.920
of course, navigate to storybook using this,

244
00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.850
but I don't know if it will look nice.

245
00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:54.460
I'll have to try.

246
00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:55.920
<v Host>Sorry, I guess my question would be, do you think</v>

247
00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.280
this might be a better product for designers,

248
00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.300
or do you feel like it's a much more

249
00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.600
developer-focused product?

250
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.120
Like, where's the sweet spot?

251
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.149
<v ->Well, they claim it's for developers and designers,</v>

252
00:14:06.149 --> 00:14:10.350
but I would say mostly developers when you are, for example,

253
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.466
developing a site and then you can quickly see how

254
00:14:13.466 --> 00:14:15.430
it renders on different screens.

255
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:18.180
For example, if you would make something like this,

256
00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:23.180
what I did, I'm trying to have the color change

257
00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:28.260
every time when you have a full 100 viewports,

258
00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.527
so if you were to make a mistake there, you would probably

259
00:14:31.527 --> 00:14:33.833
recognize the mistake easily here.

260
00:14:34.834 --> 00:14:36.188
(audience applauding)

261
00:14:36.188 --> 00:14:38.771
(upbeat music)
