Many of you are probably using TypeScript in your daily work. And why not, types make our code safer and tooling can help us more. But from time to time you probably encounter some weird behavior of the type system that you cannot fully understand. This week I want to explain the foundation of the type system of TypeScript and also contrast it a bit with other languages like PureScript.
