For the past few months, Futurice has been working together with Sanoma in creating a renewed voting advice application AKA "Vaalikone" for the 2019 Finnish parliamentary elections and the upcoming elections, such as the 2019 European Parliament election.

In this presentation, we will share insights into the project and how we created a service that was used by a large part of the population with voting right. We came up with a neat solution for handling the peak load of 28M requests/hour during the election night. The UI was implemented using Preact with TypeScript.

Presenters: Olavi Haapala and Markus Manninen
