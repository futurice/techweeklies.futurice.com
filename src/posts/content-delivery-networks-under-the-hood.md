<!--- You can insert a short description here -->
Maybe you are familiar with using Content Delivery Neworks, or CDNs for short? Maybe you have even used them yourself? Or maybe this is all news to you?

Let’s have a talk where we look into CDNs under the hood. What are they, who are they, why should you use one (or maybe should not), and how do they work? The CDN landscape is also changing, so we’ll dive into that a bit.

And we’ll go through why you shouldn’t build one yourself.
