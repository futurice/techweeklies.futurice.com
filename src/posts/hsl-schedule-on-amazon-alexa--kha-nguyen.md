"Hey Alexa, when does the tram 3 to Meilahti leave?"

Kha Nguyen built an application combining Amazon Alexa's voice assistant with Helsinki Regional Transport Authority's (HSL) data API to build functionality to know when specific buses and trams leave from near his home.

As you know, Amazon Alexa is a virtual assistant that can be programmed to make your life easier. Kha explains how Alexa works behind the scenes and how to use its interfaces to run custom Javascript code based on different voice commands and intents.

After this talk, you'll know the basics of building custom Alexa commands.
