Site is slow, site is fast.
Have you ever wondered how people "measure" loading on the web?
Perhaps you have a sense of how browsers load assets, and want to make the most of it?
We'll go over the new Tech Weeklies website, and see how different optimisations impact loading times.
CSS, Fonts, JS, and a good bit of UX; we've got it all at our weekly web performance emporium. Don't miss out!
