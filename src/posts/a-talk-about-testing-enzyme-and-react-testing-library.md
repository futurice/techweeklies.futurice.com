Today Enzyme is a standard library for writing tests in React. But there is also a new player – react-testing-library. The presentation is a comparison of Enzyme and react-testing-library, which aims to make testing more accessible, predictable and user-oriented. Let’s cover their philosophical differences, getting false results and misuse of patterns.

Presenter: Denis Bakhmutov
