<!--- You can insert a short description here -->

The talk will explain both the process and provide code examples on how to bootstrap your latest project in the least disruptive way. An example of expanding a publicly available project in several phases will be given (along with the source). At the end you will learn what you can get for free, what are some low hanging fruit, and then where to concentrate your efforts as you scale. If you have an interest in creating a UI Component library or Design System this is a great precursor and first step for your project.
