React and Redux are told to embrace Functional Programming (FP) but nothing comes enforced nor explained. Those seeking better FP solutions often come to Elm (A strictly typed purely functional language used for Frontend apps), but it remains a hard sell for the client or employer. Everyone wants “just React.” But today it is possible to get a more FP-like experience using some off-the-shelf libraries and TypeScript configuration. 

Topics covered: Redux-loop middleware, the RemoteData pattern from Elm, the Maybe / Just / Nothing monad

Presenter: James Stone
