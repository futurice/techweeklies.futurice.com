<!--- You can insert a short description here -->

Putting forms on a web page is a common task in web development.
And yet, making those forms accessible seems disproportionately hard, as evidenced by the large number of inaccessible forms one comes across daily.
It needn't be so.
Are you wondering about "simple" things and reluctant to ask?
Have you had a client declare a piece of software "finished" when it is only visually so?
Do you want to increase the light we shed on accessibility?
This talk might be for you!
