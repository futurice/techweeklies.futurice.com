<!--- You can insert a short description here -->
Software development is often described as “craftsmanship”. What is craftsmanship? And does that mean software development and programming have something in common with, say, a more traditional craft like handicrafts (sewing, knitting, weaving, etc)?

In this presentation, I will talk about the meta level similarities between handicrafts and programming, and demonstrate that any crafter/maker has the essentials meta level skills of a programmer.
