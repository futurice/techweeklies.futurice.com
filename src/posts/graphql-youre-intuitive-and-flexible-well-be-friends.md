<!--- You can insert a short description here -->
When you meet a new, interesting person and get to know them, there are usually certain stages in the process. It’s more or less the same when you get to know any new, fascinating technology. If it is exciting and practical even after these stages, you could compare it to making a friend.

In this talk, I will tell about my journey getting to know GraphQL, and share things I have learned along the way, and things I enjoy about it.
