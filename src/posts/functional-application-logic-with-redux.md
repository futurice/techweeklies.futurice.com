Redux is a great solution for managing application-level state that we use in a lot of our projects, for good reason. However, it does not provide any guidance for organizing application logic. In this talk, Denis shares a declarative approach to integrating logic into Redux apps that is well encapsulated, easy to test, and applicable to various use cases.
