<!--- You can insert a short description here -->
Times of crisis are a test for how (or not) we have integrated accessibility into our processes. When the urge to help and to do things well apply tension, the shortcuts we rely on might mislead us.

In this talk, we will reframe the conventional “edge case” as a “stress case”. We will cover how accessibility benefits even more people in a crisis, and how our own processes can or should adapt under stress.

The last thing I want to do with this, is to put yet more pressure on you; we already have enough of that. Instead, I want us to look at the systems that are bigger than us, and which will only change with our collective effort.
