<!--- You can insert a short description here -->
Getting rid of toxic team and individual shaming habits

Test with these simple unit tests, if you are feeling shame on a personal level or as a team member:

As a developer, I’m not ________ enough.
As a team member, I’m not _______ enough.

If your mind auto-filled these for you with one or more words, this presentation is for you.

In this talk, we’ll be looking at non-technical terms like shame, guilt and scarcity and see how they might be manifesting in our own thoughts, habits and maybe even team practices. We’ll also be discussing how to live with thoughts and change our habits and team practices.

Presenter: Senja Jarva, Front-end Developer
