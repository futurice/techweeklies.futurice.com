<!--- You can insert a short description here -->
Have you ever ended up in a situation where you need to do a small change to an old TS/JS app that no-one has touched in months? Quite often, in these situations, the app does not work anymore, because of a change in a dependency or a dependency of a dependency. This is why http://npmplease.com/​ exists. The JS ecosystem is inherently broken. There are cases where malicious packages have made thousands or millions of projects stop working.

In this presentation, Olavi will talk about how to avoid ending up in a huge mess with your node_modules, and how to handle dependencies in a future-proof way without loosing your time and energy waiting for “npmplease”.
