Browsers can save any website as a PDF, so why should we use a server-side pdf generator to provide PDFs to our users? This talk by Judith explores the browsers ability to generate PDF documents with repeating headers, footers and page numbers and how we can apply these learnings to make a normal website more printer friendly.
