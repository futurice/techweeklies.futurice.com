<!--- You can insert a short description here -->
There are a lot of similarities in the open source communities of software developers and the print-and-play communities of board game designers. I started designing my first table top game this summer and found my Python skills very valuable when I learned how to build a Python program that automates the creation of cards used in the game.

By automating the process, I can tweak game balance and test out different options by just modifying data and letting computers do what they are good at: scaling. In this session Iâ€™ll talk about the print-and-play table top community and tell more about my Python script.
