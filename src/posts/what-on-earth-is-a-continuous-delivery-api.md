<!--- You can insert a short description here -->
In modern cloud-native development every second counts. Developers should be self-serving the tech they need and work in a seamless developer experience. How do you manage this without locking in into a PaaS like setup? 

Humanitec is building the Continuous Delivery API. The tool helps you to achieve a PaaS like degree of automation on top of the tools you are using today. This episode will show-case the future of CI/CD and is great for anyone interested in developer productivity, workflows or DevOps in general.
