<!--- You can insert a short description here -->
React Hooks have been out for a while already and they have quickly become the new recommended way of handling component local state and side effects in React function components. Getting started with React hooks is quite straightforward, but the more you use them, the more you need to change the way you think about your components, especially when it comes to the useEffect hook. There are certain rules that you have to follow and certain pitfalls to avoid.

This presentation assumes you know the basics of React hooks and we will dive a bit deeper into how they can be used and how they should be used. In this presentation, I will explain the rules of hooks and how we messed up with those and I ended up wasting almost a month of my work time fixing the mess.
